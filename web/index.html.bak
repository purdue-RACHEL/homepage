            <h2 style="text-align: center; color: darkgreen;">Project Name: R.A.C.H.E.L.</h2>
            <h2>Project Description:</h2> Project R.A.C.H.E.L. is an enhancement to the original game of table tennis. 
			Users will no longer need to keep track of their own score; using a contact microphone array, R.A.C.H.E.L. 
			determines when the ball has bounced, which side of the table it bounced on, and thus, can detect erroneous
			bounces. In real-time, the score will be displayed on the table, using an overhead projector system. The
			users can interact with the system through a button matrix, to start and end games, change the scoring mode, 
			and make other preferential modifications to customize the R.A.C.H.E.L. experience. <br> <br>
			As a stretch goal, we intend to extend R.A.C.H.E.L. to incorporate a selection of minigames and display modes. 
			Using a camera above the table, we intend to track the ball in real-time. This would allow for games that 
			require the user to hit the ball onto specified parts of the table, highlighted by the projector. Or the 
			user could display the ball’s motion trail to view their play patterns. Similarly, we intend to interface 
			the camera to track hand gestures, which could also be used for user input to the game. Finally, we hope to 
			determine, within a few inches, where the ball has bounced on the table, exclusively using the piezoelectric 
			sensors.<br> <br>

					<h4>
						Stretch Goals:
					</h4>
					<li>An extra minigame that changes the table as the game is played, based on ball bounces.</li>
					<ul>The table would be divided into a 5x10 grid of cells, that each have two possible states: fair and foul. At the beginning of each rally all cells will be set to fair, and if a ball bounces in a cell during the rally it will become foul. If, at anytime during the rally, the ball bounces in a foul cell, it will increment the score as if the ball missed the table. The cells will be displayed using the projector, and updated within a second of the ball bounce.</ul>
					<li>Ball Tracking</li>
						<ul>The ability to accurately track the ball within a 6’’x6’’ square, with a delay of under a second, using a camera.</ul>
					<li>Gestures</li>
					<ul>Offer an alternative to the button matrix, by allowing the user to hover a paddle over areas of the table and interact with a projected user interface.</ul>
					<li>Triangulation</li>
					<ul>The ability to accurately track the ball within a 6’’x6’’ square, with a delay of under a second, using a microphone array.</ul>

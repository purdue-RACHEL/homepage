		I'm an Iowa native and a military brat who loves to learn anything and everything about how computers work.
		My goals for this semester of ECE477 revolve around personal growth. I hope to hone my systems and software 
		engineering skills by taking a more structured approach with this project than I have with my personal projects in the past.

	<b><u>About:</u></b>
	I am an Indiana native who likes to enjoy the great outdoors in dangerous ways. Some of my hobbies include
    skiing, rock climbing, and skydiving. My programming expertise is in microcontrollers - I've been a teaching
    assistant in a microcontroller course, I've used them for research, and I've worked on consumer grade items
    with them for Garmin.

	I'm just a guy who likes computers and making things. I gained experience with GBOSS (Ground based operational surveillance systems) this summer and I TA for the digital logic class here at Purdue. Outside of school, I enjoying art and metalworking. I am excited to collaborate and create a fun and complete project; and maybe brush up on my table tennis skills while I'm at it.

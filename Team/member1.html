	<b><u>About:</u></b>
    I have come all the way from Poland to design, prototype, and innovate R.A.C.H.E.L. to the next level. I have experience in software engineering through an internship with Complete Structural Counsulting this past summer (not that useful for this project sadly). I have had experience with PCB design in ECE 362's miniproject "MIDI Polyphonic Synthesizer" and EPIC's Beep Baseball Team.
    I am excited to work with the R.A.C.H.E.L. team, in which, 2 of the members I have met previously in elementary school and Avon middle school. But besides school, I love playing Ultimate Frisbee and I live a pretty active lifestyle by engaging in a diverse selection of sports. 
    Thank you for reading about me.
